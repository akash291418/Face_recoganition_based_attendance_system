Face Recognition based Attendance Management System built using Python. Attendance marking is done on spreadsheet.

Requirements:
1. Hardware: USB camera/ Smart Phone.
2. Software: Python 2.7.

First, install face recognition API available [here](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition).
Then install other python libraries like OpenCV2, Tkinter and xlwt. 
Create a new folder named "database" in the same directory and add faces.

Run the code!!
